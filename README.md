# Doing Attestation and Signing with GRASP

In order to do Remote Attestation (RATS) in an ISP environment a source of freshness may be needed by Attesters.
The use of Epoch IDs as describes in the RATS architecture is one way.

There is a general need for freshness in the GRASP infrastructure involving M_FLOOD'ed information.

This repository contains a proposed GRASP ASA that provides freshness.
